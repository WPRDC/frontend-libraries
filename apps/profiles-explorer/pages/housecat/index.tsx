          <strong>
            Affordable housing is a growing issue of regional importance in our
            community.
          </strong>
          {'  '}
          In May, 2016, the City of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Affordable Housing Task
          Force released its report to the Mayor and City Council. The report
          called for the creation of a centralized, publicly-accessible
          repository of affordable housing data to be hosted by the Western
          Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. In addition to including lists of
          deed and income-restricted properties, the Task Force also sought to
          use data to track compliance, monitor housing conditions, and
          establish an &lsquo;early warning system&rsquo; when use restrictions
          change, or condition issues threaten overall affordability and family
          stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support this goal of using data to proactively monitor threats to
          affordability, the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center at the
          University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Mellon CREATE Lab partnered
          to develop a frequently-updated collection of data about subsidized
          properties in Allegheny County from approximately 20 different
          databases provided by HUD and the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency
          (PHFA). This tool launched in April 2022 allows people to view data
          for a project, and filter the data to display a subset of properties
          including those with low inspection scores and those that may have
          their subsidies expire in coming years. Users of the data explorer are
          also able to create watch lists of properties whose affordability is
          at risk. Properties can be viewed on a map, with data associated with
          each property displayed on screen.
